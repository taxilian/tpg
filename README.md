# tasks

Lightweight task management for AI agents. SQLite-backed, CLI-driven.

## Requirements

This tool assumes you're using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). The `tasks onboard` command automatically configures Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context at session start and before context compaction.

**Not using Claude Code?** You'll need to manually integrate the workflow context into your agent setup:
1. Run `tasks prime` to see the context that should be injected
2. Run `tasks onboard` to see what it would configure
3. Add the `tasks prime` output to your `AGENTS.md`, system prompt, or equivalent session-start mechanism

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/baiirun/dotworld-tasks/cmd/tasks@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baiirun/dotworld-tasks.git
cd dotworld-tasks
go build -o tasks ./cmd/tasks
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize database (creates ~/.world/tasks/tasks.db)
tasks init

# Create a task
tasks add "Implement user authentication" -p myproject --priority 1
# Output: ts-a1b2c3

# See what's ready to work on
tasks ready -p myproject

# Start working
tasks start ts-a1b2c3

# Log progress
tasks log ts-a1b2c3 "Added JWT token generation"

# Mark complete
tasks done ts-a1b2c3
```

## CLI Reference

### Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tasks init` | Initialize the database |
| `tasks add <title>` | Create a task (returns ID) |
| `tasks list` | List all tasks |
| `tasks show <id>` | Show task details, logs, and dependencies |
| `tasks ready` | Show tasks ready for work (open + deps met) |
| `tasks status` | Project overview for agent spin-up |
| `tasks prime` | Output context for Claude Code hooks |

### Work Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tasks start <id>` | Set task to in_progress |
| `tasks done <id>` | Mark task complete |
| `tasks cancel <id> [reason]` | Cancel task (close without completing) |
| `tasks block <id> <reason>` | Mark blocked with reason |
| `tasks log <id> <message>` | Add timestamped log entry |
| `tasks append <id> <text>` | Append to task description |

### Organization

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tasks parent <id> <epic-id>` | Set task's parent epic |
| `tasks blocks <id> <other>` | Add blocking relationship (other blocked until id done) |
| `tasks dep <id> --on <other>` | Add dependency (id blocked until other is done) |
| `tasks graph` | Show dependency graph |
| `tasks projects` | List all projects |
| `tasks add -e <title>` | Create an epic instead of task |

### Flags

| Flag | Commands | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `-p, --project` | all | Filter/set project scope |
| `-e, --epic` | add | Create epic instead of task |
| `--priority` | add | Priority: 1=high, 2=medium (default), 3=low |
| `--parent` | add | Set parent epic at creation |
| `--blocks` | add | Set task this will block at creation |
| `--status` | list | Filter by status |

## ID Format

IDs are auto-generated with type prefixes:
- `ts-XXXXXX` — tasks (e.g., `ts-a1b2c3`)
- `ep-XXXXXX` — epics (e.g., `ep-f0a20b`)

## Agent Workflow

### Spin-up (new agent joining)

```bash
# Get project overview
tasks status -p myproject

# Output:
# Project: myproject
#
# Summary: 3 open, 1 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 done (2 ready)
#
# In progress:
#   [ts-a1b2c3] Implement auth middleware
#
# Ready for work:
#   [ts-d4e5f6] Add login endpoint (pri 1)
#   [ts-g7h8i9] Write auth tests (pri 2)
```

### Pick up work

```bash
# See what's unblocked
tasks ready -p myproject

# Read full context
tasks show ts-d4e5f6

# Claim it
tasks start ts-d4e5f6
```

### While working

```bash
# Log progress (timestamped audit trail)
tasks log ts-d4e5f6 "Implemented POST /login"
tasks log ts-d4e5f6 "Added rate limiting"

# Update description with decisions/context
tasks append ts-d4e5f6 "Using bcrypt for password hashing"
```

### Finish or hand off

```bash
# Complete
tasks done ts-d4e5f6

# Or cancel if no longer needed
tasks cancel ts-d4e5f6 "Requirements changed"

# Or mark blocked for next agent
tasks block ts-d4e5f6 "Need API spec for OAuth flow"

# If task is part of an epic, update the epic too
tasks append ep-a1b2c3 "Completed auth endpoint, next: write tests"
```

### Dependencies

Use dependencies to enforce task ordering. A task with unmet dependencies won't appear in `tasks ready`.

```bash
# Create a task that blocks another (at creation time)
tasks add "Build API" -p myproject --blocks ts-frontend
# New task blocks ts-frontend, so ts-frontend can't start until the new task is done

# Or add blocking relationship to existing tasks
tasks blocks ts-backend ts-frontend
# Or equivalently:
tasks dep ts-frontend --on ts-backend

# View all dependencies
tasks graph

# Output:
# ts-frontend [open] Build frontend components
#   └── ts-backend [in_progress] Implement API endpoints
```

The `ready` command automatically filters out tasks with unmet dependencies, so agents only see work they can actually start.

### Epics

Group related tasks under an epic for organization:

```bash
# Create an epic
tasks add "Authentication system" -p myproject -e
# Output: ep-a1b2c3

# Create task under epic (at creation time)
tasks add "Implement login" -p myproject --parent ep-a1b2c3

# Or assign existing tasks to the epic
tasks parent ts-d4e5f6 ep-a1b2c3
tasks parent ts-g7h8i9 ep-a1b2c3

# View task with parent
tasks show ts-d4e5f6
# Output includes: Parent: ep-a1b2c3
```

## Claude Code Integration

The `tasks prime` command outputs workflow context designed for Claude Code hooks. It ensures agents maintain context about the tasks workflow across sessions and after context compaction.

### Hook Configuration

Add to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "command": "tasks prime" }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      { "command": "tasks prime" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### What `tasks prime` outputs

- **SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL**: Mandatory checklist for logging progress and updating status before ending sessions
- **Core Rules**: When to use `tasks` (strategic, cross-session) vs TodoWrite (tactical, within-session)
- **Essential Commands**: Quick reference grouped by workflow phase
- **Current State**: Live summary of open, in-progress, and blocked tasks

This ensures agents never forget the workflow, even after context compaction.

## Data Model

- **Items**: Tasks or epics with title, description, status, priority
- **Status**: `open` → `in_progress` → `done` (or `blocked`, `canceled`)
- **Dependencies**: Task A can depend on Task B (A is blocked until B is done)
- **Logs**: Timestamped audit trail per item
- **Projects**: String tag to scope work (e.g., "gaia", "myapp")

Database location: `~/.world/tasks/tasks.db`

## Design

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture and schema details.

## Goals

1. Track tasks within larger work (epics)
2. Progress reports for current work and what's left
3. Split work for parallel agents
4. Track dependencies for ordering
5. Prioritize work
6. Store context so agents can resume where others left off

## Non-Goals

- Git sync (single-player, local only)
- Multiplayer / collaboration
- Complex workflows
