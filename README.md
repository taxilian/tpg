```

## Design

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture and schema details.

## Goals

1. Track tasks within larger work (epics)
2. Progress reports for current work and what's left
3. Split work for parallel agents
4. Track dependencies for ordering
5. Prioritize work
6. Store context so agents can resume where others left off

## Non-Goals

- Git sync (single-player, local only)
- Multiplayer / collaboration
- Complex workflows (molecules, convoys, etc.)
