## Agent Workflow

### Spin-up (new agent joining)

```bash
# Get project overview
prog status -p myproject

# Output:
# Project: myproject
#
# Summary: 3 open, 1 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 done (2 ready)
#
# In progress:
#   [ts-a1b2c3] Implement auth middleware
#
# Ready for work:
#   [ts-d4e5f6] Add login endpoint (pri 1)
#   [ts-g7h8i9] Write auth tests (pri 2)
```

### Pick up work

```bash
# See what's unblocked
prog ready -p myproject

# Read full context
prog show ts-d4e5f6

# Claim it
prog start ts-d4e5f6
```

### While working

```bash
# Log progress (timestamped audit trail)
prog log ts-d4e5f6 "Implemented POST /login"
prog log ts-d4e5f6 "Added rate limiting"

# Append to description with decisions/context
prog append ts-d4e5f6 "Using bcrypt for password hashing"

# Replace description entirely
prog desc ts-d4e5f6 "Implement login endpoint with JWT auth and rate limiting"

# Or edit in your editor
prog edit ts-d4e5f6
```

### Finish or hand off

```bash
# Complete
prog done ts-d4e5f6

# Or cancel if no longer needed
prog cancel ts-d4e5f6 "Requirements changed"

# Or mark blocked for next agent
prog block ts-d4e5f6 "Need API spec for OAuth flow"

# If task is part of an epic, update the epic too
prog append ep-a1b2c3 "Completed auth endpoint, next: write tests"
```

### Dependencies

Use dependencies to enforce task ordering. A task with unmet dependencies won't appear in `prog ready`.

```bash
# Create a task that blocks another (at creation time)
prog add "Build API" -p myproject --blocks ts-frontend
# New task blocks ts-frontend, so ts-frontend can't start until the new task is done

# Or add blocking relationship to existing tasks
prog blocks ts-backend ts-frontend

# View all dependencies
prog graph

# Output:
# ts-frontend [open] Build frontend components
#   └── ts-backend [in_progress] Implement API endpoints
```

The `ready` command automatically filters out tasks with unmet dependencies, so agents only see work they can actually start.

### Epics

Group related tasks under an epic for organization:

```bash
# Create an epic
prog add "Authentication system" -p myproject -e
# Output: ep-a1b2c3

# Create task under epic (at creation time)
prog add "Implement login" -p myproject --parent ep-a1b2c3

# Or assign existing tasks to the epic
prog parent ts-d4e5f6 ep-a1b2c3
prog parent ts-g7h8i9 ep-a1b2c3

# View task with parent
prog show ts-d4e5f6
# Output includes: Parent: ep-a1b2c3
```

## Context Engine

The context engine captures tacit knowledge—things agents learn that aren't obvious from the code. This knowledge persists across sessions, helping future agents avoid rediscovering the same insights.

### Data Model

**Concepts** are knowledge categories within a project:
```
auth          - "Token lifecycle, refresh, session coupling"
database      - "SQLite patterns, schema migrations"
config        - "Environment loading, precedence rules"
```

**Learnings** are specific insights tagged with concepts:
```
lrn-abc123: Token refresh has race condition
  Detail: The mutex only protects token write, not refresh check. See PR #423.
  Concepts: auth, concurrency
  Files: auth/token.go
  Task: ts-def456
```

### Two-Phase Retrieval

Agents retrieve context in phases to minimize token usage:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PHASE 1: Discovery                                          │
│   prog show <task>                                          │
│     → Task details, logs, deps                              │
│     → Suggested concepts: auth (3), config (2)              │
│                                                             │
│   Agent decides which concepts are relevant                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PHASE 2: Scan                                               │
│   prog context -c auth --summary                            │
│     → auth: Token lifecycle, refresh, session coupling      │
│     → lrn-abc: Token refresh has race condition             │
│     → lrn-def: Auth tokens expire after 1 hour              │
│                                                             │
│   Agent sees concept summary, then learning one-liners      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PHASE 3: Load                                               │
│   prog context --id lrn-abc                                 │
│     → Full detail, files, linked task                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each phase filters, so agents only load what's actually relevant.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `prog concepts` | List concepts for a project |
| `prog context -c <name>` | Retrieve learnings by concept(s) |
| `prog context -q <query>` | Full-text search on learnings |
| `prog learn <summary>` | Log a new learning |
| `prog learn edit <id>` | Edit a learning's summary or detail |
| `prog learn stale <id>` | Mark learning as outdated |
| `prog learn rm <id>` | Delete a learning |

#### Retrieval Examples

```bash
# List concepts to see what knowledge exists
prog concepts -p myproject
# NAME          LEARNINGS  LAST UPDATED  SUMMARY
# auth                  3  2h ago        Token lifecycle, refresh
# database              2  1d ago        SQLite patterns

# Retrieve by concept (union of multiple concepts)
prog context -c auth -c database -p myproject

# Full-text search when you don't know the concept
prog context -q "race condition" -p myproject

# Include stale learnings for historical context
prog context -c auth --include-stale -p myproject
```

### Logging Learnings (Reflection)

Log learnings at the end of a session during reflection. This is more efficient than logging during work because:

- The learning is validated through implementation
- You can synthesize related discoveries into one insight
- You know what's signal vs noise

```bash
# Basic learning with concepts
prog learn "Token refresh has race condition" -c auth -c concurrency -p myproject

# With related files
prog learn "Config loads from env first, then file" -c config -p myproject -f config.go

# With full detail
prog learn "summary" -c concept -p myproject --detail "full explanation..."
```

**What makes a good learning?**

- Things that aren't obvious from reading the code
- Gotchas, edge cases, "why" decisions
- Context that would help the next agent

**What to avoid logging:**

- Things already documented in code comments
- Obvious behavior that code makes clear
- Temporary workarounds (mark as stale instead)

#### Concept Hygiene

- **Reuse existing concepts** — check `prog concepts` before creating new ones
- **Create sparingly** — prefer broader concepts over narrow ones
- **Use clear names** — `auth` not `authentication-and-authorization`

### Grooming and Compaction

Over time, knowledge accumulates and may become stale or redundant.

#### Marking Learnings Stale

When a learning becomes outdated but is still useful for reference:

```bash
prog learn stale lrn-abc123 --reason "Refactored in v2"
```

Stale learnings are excluded by default but can be included with `--include-stale`.

#### Concept Grooming (coming soon)

```bash
# Merge fragmented concepts
prog concepts merge authn auth

# Archive unused concepts
prog concepts archive legacy-api
```

#### Learning Compaction (coming soon)

Summarize old learnings into fewer, denser learnings:

```bash
# Preview what would be compacted
prog compact auth --dry-run

# Compact learnings older than 30 days
prog compact auth
```

This keeps the knowledge base navigable as it grows.

### Resources & Inspiration

The context engine design draws from several projects and papers:

- **[CASS Memory System](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system)** — Lesson extraction and rule validation through evidence gates. Influenced our approach to learning quality (actionable, specific, pattern-based).

- **[AgentFS](https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs)** — SQLite-based agent memory with audit trails. Validated our choice of SQLite for durability and the importance of linking learnings to tasks.

- **[Dynamic Context Discovery](https://cursor.com/blog/dynamic-context-discovery)** (Cursor) — Two-phase retrieval with stubs in context, full content on-demand. Directly inspired our `--summary` → `--id` pattern for 46%+ token reduction.

- **[Everything is Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05470)** (Xu et al., 2024) — File-system abstraction for context engineering. Reinforced concepts-over-files approach and the value of structured knowledge retrieval.

## Claude Code Integration

The `prog onboard` command configures Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context at session start and before context compaction. This ensures agents maintain context about the prog workflow across sessions.

**Using a different agent?** (Cursor, Opencode, Droid, Codex, Gemini, etc.)

1. Copy the Task Tracking snippet from `CLAUDE.md` to your agent's instruction file (`.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.)
2. If your tool supports hooks, add `prog prime` to session start
3. If no hooks, run `prog prime` and paste output into agent context

### Hook Configuration

Running `prog onboard` adds this to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "command": "prog prime" }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      { "command": "prog prime" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### What `prog prime` outputs

- **SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL**: Mandatory checklist for logging progress and updating status before ending sessions
- **Core Rules**: When to use `prog` (strategic, cross-session) vs TodoWrite (tactical, within-session)
- **Essential Commands**: Quick reference grouped by workflow phase
- **Current State**: Live summary of open, in-progress, and blocked tasks

This ensures agents never forget the workflow, even after context compaction.

## Interactive TUI

Launch with `prog tui` (or `prog ui`):

```
prog  12/47 items  status:oib

◐ ts-234d9f  Set up Bubble Tea scaffold       [tasks]
○ ts-9566cd  Task list view with indicators   [tasks]
○ ts-f39592  Vim keybind navigation           [tasks]
```

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j/k` or arrows | Move up/down |
| `g/G` or Home/End | Jump to first/last |
| `enter` or `l` | View task details |
| `esc` or `h` | Go back to list |
| `q` | Quit |

### Actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Start task |
| `d` | Mark done |
| `b` | Block (prompts for reason) |
| `L` | Log progress (prompts for message) |
| `c` | Cancel task |
| `D` | Delete task |
| `a` | Add dependency |
| `r` | Refresh |

### Filtering

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search by title/ID/description |
| `p` | Filter by project (partial match) |
| `1-5` | Toggle status: 1=open 2=in_progress 3=blocked 4=done 5=canceled |
| `0` | Show all statuses |
| `esc` | Clear filters |

## Data Model

- **Items**: Tasks or epics with title, description, status, priority
- **Status**: `open` → `in_progress` → `done` (or `blocked`, `canceled`)
- **Dependencies**: Task A can depend on Task B (A is blocked until B is done)
- **Logs**: Timestamped audit trail per item
- **Projects**: String tag to scope work (e.g., "gaia", "myapp")
- **Concepts**: Knowledge categories within a project (e.g., "auth", "database")
- **Learnings**: Specific insights tagged with concepts, with summary and detail

Database location: `~/.prog/prog.db`

## Goals

1. Track tasks within larger work (epics)
2. Progress reports for current work and what's left
3. Split work for parallel agents
4. Track dependencies for ordering
5. Prioritize work
6. Store context so agents can resume where others left off
7. Capture tacit knowledge that persists across sessions

## Non-Goals

- Git sync (single-player, local only)
- Multiplayer / collaboration
- Complex workflows
