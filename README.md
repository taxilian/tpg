Lightweight task management for AI agents. SQLite-backed, CLI-driven.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install baiirun/tap/tasks
```

### Go install

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
go install github.com/baiirun/dotworld-tasks/cmd/tasks@latest
```

### Build from source

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baiirun/dotworld-tasks.git
cd dotworld-tasks
go build -o tasks ./cmd/tasks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize database (creates ~/.world/tasks/tasks.db)
tasks init

# Set up Claude Code hooks (recommended)
tasks onboard

# Create a task
tasks add "Implement user authentication" -p myproject --priority 1
# Output: ts-a1b2c3

# See what's ready to work on
tasks ready -p myproject

# Start working
tasks start ts-a1b2c3

# Log progress
tasks log ts-a1b2c3 "Added JWT token generation"

# Mark complete
tasks done ts-a1b2c3
```

| `tasks graph` | Show dependency graph |
| `tasks projects` | List all projects |
| `tasks add -e <title>` | Create an epic instead of task |

### Flags

| Flag | Commands | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `-p, --project` | all | Filter/set project scope |
| `-e, --epic` | add | Create epic instead of task |
| `--priority` | add | Priority: 1=high, 2=medium (default), 3=low |

## ID Format

IDs are auto-generated with type prefixes:
- `ts-XXXXXX` — tasks (e.g., `ts-a1b2c3`)
- `ep-XXXXXX` — epics (e.g., `ep-f0a20b`)

## Agent Workflow

### Spin-up (new agent joining)

```bash
# Get project overview
tasks status -p myproject

# Output:
# Project: myproject
#
# Summary: 3 open, 1 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 done (2 ready)
#
# In progress:
#   [ts-a1b2c3] Implement auth middleware
#
# Ready for work:
#   [ts-d4e5f6] Add login endpoint (pri 1)
#   [ts-g7h8i9] Write auth tests (pri 2)
```

### Pick up work

```bash
# See what's unblocked
tasks ready -p myproject

# Read full context
tasks show ts-d4e5f6

# Claim it
tasks start ts-d4e5f6
```

### While working

```bash
# Log progress (timestamped audit trail)
tasks log ts-d4e5f6 "Implemented POST /login"
tasks log ts-d4e5f6 "Added rate limiting"

# Append to description with decisions/context
tasks append ts-d4e5f6 "Using bcrypt for password hashing"

# Replace description entirely
tasks desc ts-d4e5f6 "Implement login endpoint with JWT auth and rate limiting"

# Or edit in your editor
tasks edit ts-d4e5f6
```

### Finish or hand off

```bash
# Complete
tasks done ts-d4e5f6

# Or cancel if no longer needed
tasks cancel ts-d4e5f6 "Requirements changed"

# Or mark blocked for next agent
tasks block ts-d4e5f6 "Need API spec for OAuth flow"

# If task is part of an epic, update the epic too
tasks append ep-a1b2c3 "Completed auth endpoint, next: write tests"
```

### Dependencies

Use dependencies to enforce task ordering. A task with unmet dependencies won't appear in `tasks ready`.

```bash
# Create a task that blocks another (at creation time)
tasks add "Build API" -p myproject --blocks ts-frontend
# New task blocks ts-frontend, so ts-frontend can't start until the new task is done

# Or add blocking relationship to existing tasks
tasks blocks ts-backend ts-frontend

# View all dependencies
tasks graph

# Output:
# ts-frontend [open] Build frontend components
#   └── ts-backend [in_progress] Implement API endpoints
```

The `ready` command automatically filters out tasks with unmet dependencies, so agents only see work they can actually start.

### Epics

Group related tasks under an epic for organization:

```bash
# Create an epic
tasks add "Authentication system" -p myproject -e
# Output: ep-a1b2c3

# Create task under epic (at creation time)
tasks add "Implement login" -p myproject --parent ep-a1b2c3

# Or assign existing tasks to the epic
tasks parent ts-d4e5f6 ep-a1b2c3
tasks parent ts-g7h8i9 ep-a1b2c3

# View task with parent
tasks show ts-d4e5f6
# Output includes: Parent: ep-a1b2c3
```

## Claude Code Integration

The `tasks onboard` command configures Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context at session start and before context compaction. This ensures agents maintain context about the tasks workflow across sessions.

**Using a different agent?** (Cursor, Opencode, Droid, Codex, Gemini, etc.)

1. Copy the Task Tracking snippet from `CLAUDE.md` to your agent's instruction file (`.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.)
2. If your tool supports hooks, add `tasks prime` to session start
3. If no hooks, run `tasks prime` and paste output into agent context

### Hook Configuration

Running `tasks onboard` adds this to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "command": "tasks prime" }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      { "command": "tasks prime" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### What `tasks prime` outputs

- **SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL**: Mandatory checklist for logging progress and updating status before ending sessions
- **Core Rules**: When to use `tasks` (strategic, cross-session) vs TodoWrite (tactical, within-session)
- **Essential Commands**: Quick reference grouped by workflow phase
- **Current State**: Live summary of open, in-progress, and blocked tasks

This ensures agents never forget the workflow, even after context compaction.

## Data Model

- **Items**: Tasks or epics with title, description, status, priority
- **Status**: `open` → `in_progress` → `done` (or `blocked`, `canceled`)
- **Dependencies**: Task A can depend on Task B (A is blocked until B is done)
- **Logs**: Timestamped audit trail per item
- **Projects**: String tag to scope work (e.g., "gaia", "myapp")

Database location: `~/.world/tasks/tasks.db`

## Design

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture and schema details.

## Goals

1. Track tasks within larger work (epics)
2. Progress reports for current work and what's left
3. Split work for parallel agents
4. Track dependencies for ordering
5. Prioritize work
6. Store context so agents can resume where others left off

## Non-Goals

- Git sync (single-player, local only)
- Multiplayer / collaboration
- Complex workflows
