    "results": "Completed: Extended template loading to include worktree root\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nModified internal/templates/templates.go to support loading templates from both worktree-local and worktree-root directories:\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. Added 'bufio' import for parsing .git files\n2. Added findWorktreeRoot() - detects if CWD is in a git worktree by searching for .git file\n3. Added parseGitFile() - parses gitdir: path from .git file to find main repo root\n4. Updated GetTemplateLocations() to include worktree root templates:\n   - Priority: worktree-local \u003e worktree-root \u003e user \u003e global\n   - Worktree-local templates override worktree-root templates\n   - Only adds worktree root if different from local (avoids duplicates)\n   - Supports both .tpg/templates and .tgz/templates (backward compatibility)\n\n### Requirements Met:\n- ✅ Include worktree .tpg/templates first (highest priority)\n- ✅ Include worktree root .tpg/templates second\n- ✅ Keep user and global locations\n- ✅ Worktree-local templates override worktree-root templates\n- ✅ Does not break existing template loading\n- ✅ Handles case where worktree has no templates\n\n### Test Results:\nAll 7 TestLoadTemplatesWithWorktreeSupport tests pass:\n- loads_from_local_templates_only\n- loads_from_worktree_root_only\n- merges_local_and_worktree_root_templates_without_duplicates\n- local_templates_take_priority_over_worktree_root\n- works_in_regular_repo_without_worktree\n- returns_empty_list_when_no_templates_found\n- handles_nested_subdirectories_in_both_locations\n\nAll other template tests continue to pass.",

This works but breaks flow - users leave the TUI entirely. The bubbles library provides a textarea component that supports multi-line editing with vim-style keybindings, scrolling, and clipboard operations.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Add github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles as a dependency\n2. Create a new InputMode for textarea editing\n3. 'e' key opens built-in textarea editor (default)\n4. From textarea, Ctrl+E opens external editor with current content\n5. Ctrl+S or Ctrl+Enter saves, Esc cancels\n6. Support editing both descriptions and template variables\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Built-in textarea editor works for descriptions\n- [ ] Built-in textarea editor works for template variables\n- [ ] Easy escape hatch to external editor (Ctrl+E)\n- [ ] Clear keybinding hints shown while editing\n- [ ] Undo/cancel with Esc\n- [ ] Save with Ctrl+S or Ctrl+Enter\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- All implementation happens in worktree: .worktrees/tui-builtin-editor\n- Branch: feature/tui-builtin-editor\n- Must merge back to main when complete",

Textarea Infrastructure (ts-nc8)\n- Added bubbles/textarea dependency\n- Added InputTextarea mode and textarea fields to Model\n- Initialized textarea in New() with sensible defaults\n\n### 2. Description Editing (ts-yc1)\n- 'e' key opens built-in textarea with current description\n- Textarea displays and accepts multi-line input\n- Esc cancels editing\n- Ctrl+S saves changes to database\n- Help text shows available keybindings\n\n### 3. External Editor Fallback (ts-8oa)\n- Ctrl+E from textarea opens external editor\n- Current textarea content (including unsaved edits) passed to editor\n- Changes from external editor saved correctly\n\n### 4. Template Variable Editing (ts-5ld)\n- 'E' key enters variable edit mode\n- j/k navigates between variables\n- 'e' edits selected variable\n- Visual highlighting of selected variable\n- Added SetTemplateVar() method to db package\n\n### 5. Final Testing and Merge (ts-e9b)\n- All tests pass\n- Merged to main\n- Worktree and branch cleaned up\n\n## Key Bindings (Detail View)\n- e: Edit description (or selected variable if in variable mode)\n- E: Toggle variable edit mode\n- j/k: Navigate variables (when in variable mode)\n- Esc: Exit variable mode / Exit detail view\n\n## Key Bindings (Textarea Mode)\n- Ctrl+S: Save changes\n- Esc: Cancel editing\n- Ctrl+E: Switch to external editor",

Tests Added\n- internal/db/custom_prefixes_test.go: 7 comprehensive tests\n- internal/db/example_config_test.go: Tests exact example from task\n\n## Success Criteria Met\n✅ Config file can define custom prefixes via custom_prefixes field\n✅ Custom prefixes override defaults when accessed via GetPrefixForType()\n✅ Falls back to defaults if type not in custom_prefixes\n✅ Example config from task description works correctly\n✅ All existing tests continue to pass",

All checks pass:\n\n**Requirements:** All implemented correctly - markdown default, --json flag, all list filters supported, -o/--output for file output, full task details (description, dependencies with status, logs with timestamps, labels, template info, results).\n\n**Code Quality:** Follows project patterns (cobra command, openDB(), resolveProject(), db.ListFilter). Error handling complete. Edge cases handled (empty results, missing fields).\n\n**Tests:** Converted 12 skipped TDD tests to actual integration tests for exportMarkdown/exportJSON functions. Added 2 new JSON export tests. All 52 export tests pass.\n\n**Minor note:** Filter building logic is similar to list command but acceptable given different flag handling (flagExportAll vs flagListAll). Shared flag variables are reused from main.go.",
